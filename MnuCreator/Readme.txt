DM CD Menu Creator Ver 1.0
--------------------------

DM CD Menu Creator is a small program I made for my self, To allow people to create basic interface's for there CDS/DVD
This program comes with a easy to use visual designer, so you can add and move, resize objects.
You can chnage the color of your menus, add pictures add buttons and also set actions such as opening files or folders
Plus you can also give your menu a start sound using wav or mid filetypes.

Note to use the program you first need to compile the menu project menu.vbp to the bin folder.
